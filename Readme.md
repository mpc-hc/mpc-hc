# Media Player Classic - Home Cinema

Media Player Classic - Home Cinema (MPC-HC) is a free and open-source video and audio player for Windows. MPC-HC is based on the original Guliverkli project and contains many additional features and bug fixes.

## Development Status

The player is mature, stable, reliable, and already provides a huge amount of features.

Due to a lack of active developers, the player is currently in maintenance mode. This means that there no plans for adding any new features. Development is limited to small bug fixes. The internal codecs are developed in an external project ([LAV Filters](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters)). That project is still actively maintained, and MPC-HC will be updated periodically with the latest codecs. Same applies to code/files from other external projects that are used by MPC-HC, such as MediaInfo.

If you are a programmer and want to help improve MPC-HC, then you can do so by submitting a pull request containing your patches. If you need help or advice, visit [Trac](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/).

## System Requirements

* An SSE2-capable CPU
* Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10
* Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported
