Part A: Preparing the Visual Studio environment

 Visual Studio 2008
  1. Install Visual C++ 2008, part of the Visual Studio package which can be downloaded here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/bb633753.aspx
     Note: Express edition won't work (it's missing MFC, which MPC-HC uses).
  2. Install Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Visual Studio 2008 and all the Visual Studio updates via Windows Update (>300MB). -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=fbee1648-7106-44a7-9649-6d9f6d58056e
  3. Install Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 ATL Security Update (Comes with Windows Update) -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=294de390-3c94-49fb-a014-9a38580e64cb
  4. Install DirectX SDK (June 2010) -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba
  5. Install Windows SDK v7.1 and use its configuration tool to make it the default SDK. -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=35aeda01-421d-4ba5-b44b-543dc8c33a20
     Note: This version has a known bug regarding registering itself as the default SDK (on specific systems). 
           More info about it is available here -> http://blogs.msdn.com/windowssdk/archive/2009/08/21/windows-sdk-configuration-tool-may-report-an-error-when-os-display-format-is-not-english.aspx

 Visual Studio 2010
  1. Install Visual C++ 2010, part of Visual Studio 2010 Professional (Express won't work, other editions work fine).
  2. Install Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=75568aa6-8107-475d-948a-ef22627e57a5&displaylang=en
  3. Install the DirectX SDK (June 2010) -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba

Part B: Preparing the GCC environment
 NOTES:
  * If you installed the MSYS/MinGW package in an other directory you will have to use that path in the following steps.
  * If you don't use TortoiseSVN then the revision number will be a hard-coded one, like 1.5.2.0.

 1. Download and extract MSYS_MinGW_GCC_452_x86-x64.7z to C:\MSYS\ -> http://xhmikosr.1f0.de/tools/MSYS_MinGW_GCC_452_x86-x64.7z
    For the components and their version see: http://xhmikosr.1f0.de/tools/MSYS_MinGW_GCC_452_x86-x64_components.txt
 2. Edit the "fstab" file in C:\MSYS\etc\ to specify your MinGW path.
    Add this to it: C:\MSYS\mingw	\mingw
    Note the tab-space between mingw and \mingw
 3. Add the following environment variables (in System Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables):

    Variable    Value
    CC          gcc
    MSYS        C:\MSYS
    MINGW32     C:\MSYS\mingw
    MINGW64     C:\MSYS\mingw

Modify the "Path" environment variable by adding at the end: ;%MINGW32%\bin;%MSYS%\bin

 * Optional, if you wish to use the cutting edge GCC branch you can instead follow these steps:
  a. Delete everything in this folder: C:\MSYS\mingw\
  b. Download and extract the new MinGW GCC version into C:\MSYS\mingw\ from: http://www.xvidvideo.ru/component/docman/cat_view/28-cross-mingwgcc-x86x64.html


Part C: Downloading and compiling the MPC-HC source

1. Use a subversion client to checkout MPC-HC's trunk to C:\mpc-hc (or anywhere else you like)
    Repository URL: https://mpc-hc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mpc-hc/trunk
    The recommended SVN client is TortoiseSVN (grab it from http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads)
2. When using TortoiseSVN
    a) Create an empty directory where you want to store the source files. e.g: C:\mpc-hc
    b) Right-click on that directory and choose "SVN checkout".
    c) Put https://mpc-hc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mpc-hc/trunk in "URL of Repository" and press OK.
    d) Wait for the source tree to be downloaded.

3. Open the solution file C:\mpc-hc\mpc-hc.sln
    Change the solution's configuration to "Release" (in the toolbar).
4. Right click the MPCVideoDec project, and open up its Properties.
   There, go to Configuration Properties->Librarian->General. Change the "Additional Library Directories" to:
    For Win32 platform      $(OutDir);$(SolutionDir)lib;$(MINGW32)\lib\gcc\i686-pc-mingw32\4.5.1;$(MINGW32)\i686-pc-mingw32\lib\
    For x64 platform        $(OutDir);$(SolutionDir)lib64;$(MINGW64)\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\4.5.1;$(MINGW64)\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\

Note: If you update your GCC, make sure you change the version number in the above paths, e.g. 4.5.2
Another way to do it, is by copying the needed MinGW libs (libgcc.a and libmingwex.a) into the C:\mpc-hc\lib and C:\mpc-hc\lib64 folders.


@ECHO OFF
REM Save this script to your mpc-hc source dir
REM Get the GCC version
FOR /f "tokens=1,2 delims= " %%K IN (
  'gcc -dumpversion'
) DO (
  SET "gccver=%%K" & Call :SubGCCVer %%gccver:*Z=%%
)

REM Copy the needed libs
COPY /V /Y "%MINGW32%\i686-pc-mingw32\lib\libmingwex.a" "lib\"
rem See Part D for libmingwex.a x64
COPY /V /Y "%MINGW32%\lib\gcc\i686-pc-mingw32\%gccver%\libgcc.a" "lib\"
COPY /V /Y "%MINGW64%\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\%gccver%\libgcc.a" "lib64\"

PAUSE
EXIT /B

:SubGCCVer
SET gccver=%*
EXIT /B


5. Press OK to save the changes and close the Properties window.
6. Press F7 to build the solution.
7. You now have mpc-hc.exe under C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86
8. Open the solution file C:\mpc-hc\mpciconlib.sln
9. Press F7 to build the solution.
10. You now have mpciconlib.dll under C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86
11. Open the solution file C:\mpc-hc\mpcresources.sln
    In Visual Studio go to Build->Batch Build->Press Select All->Press Build
12. You now have mpcresources.XX.dll under C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86

Alternatively, you can use the build.bat or build_2010.bat files (run: build.bat help for more info)


Part D: Building FFmpeg x64 (libavcodec) with GCC

When building FFmpeg (project libavcodec_gcc) in 32 bit mode, GCC is used and according to the makefile that is automatically invoked from the solution. Doing so for 64 bit, requires some additional steps:
 1. Run MSYS and cd to the trunk\src\filters\transform\MPCVideoDec\ffmpeg_x64 folder
Example: cd /c/mpc-hc/src/filters/transform/MPCVideoDec/ffmpeg_x64/
(notice that the first part will most probably differ for the exact paths)
 2. checkout the MinGW64 files by running: buildmingwlibs.sh --update
 3. run the buildmingwlibs.sh script, only to compile: 
      buildmingwlibs.sh --compile
    Or
      buildmingwlibs.sh --update --compile

After the compilation is done, libgcc.a and libmingwex.a will be placed in C:\mpc-hc\lib64

Now libavcodec can be compiled from within the MPC-HC visual studio solution file, and it will be linked correctly with the other components.

Part E: Building the installer

Download Inno Setup Unicode v5.4.1 or newer from: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Install everything and then go to C:\mpc-hc\distrib, open mpc-hc_setup.iss with Inno Setup, read the first comments in the script and compile it.
Note: ISTool does not handle Unicode well so don't use it. Use Inno Setup's built-in IDE.
