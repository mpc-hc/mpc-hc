======================
+ New webpage (http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net)
+ Source code moved to GitHub (https://github.com/mpc-hc)
+ The DirectX runtime dlls are included in the distribution packages
  so it's no longer needed to install the DirectX runtime
+ MpegSplitter: support for DVD-Audio LPCM and MLP in .aob files
+ Use FFmpeg for AC3 and DTS decoding

  handled by MPC-HC, MPC-HC will automatically try to fix the registry so that each extension
  is associated to the correct icon
