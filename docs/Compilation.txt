Part A: Preparing the Visual Studio environment

 Visual Studio 2010
  1. Install Visual C++ 2010, part of Visual Studio 2010 Professional (Express won't work, other editions work fine).
  2. Install Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1 -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=75568aa6-8107-475d-948a-ef22627e57a5&displaylang=en
  3. Install the DirectX SDK (June 2010) -> http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba


Part B: Preparing the GCC environment
 NOTES:
  * If you installed the MSYS/MinGW package in an other directory you will have to use that path in the following steps.
  * If you don't use TortoiseSVN then the revision number will be a hard-coded one, like 1.6.2.0.

 1. Download and extract MSYS_MinGW_GCC_470_x86-x64.7z to "C:\MSYS" -> http://xhmikosr.1f0.de/tools/MSYS_MinGW_GCC_470_x86-x64.7z
    For the components and their version see: http://xhmikosr.1f0.de/tools/MSYS_MinGW_GCC_470_x86-x64_components.txt
 2. Edit the "fstab" file in "C:\MSYS\etc" to specify your MinGW path.
    Add this to it: C:\MSYS\mingw	\mingw
    Note the tab-space between "mingw" and "\mingw"
 3. Create a file named "build.user.bat" in "C:\mpc-hc" containing the following entries, adapted for your system:

@ECHO OFF
SET "MPCHC_MSYS=C:\MSYS"
SET "MPCHC_MINGW32=%MPCHC_MSYS%\mingw"
SET "MPCHC_MINGW64=%MPCHC_MINGW32%"


Part C: Downloading and compiling the MPC-HC source

1. Use a subversion client to checkout MPC-HC's trunk to "C:\mpc-hc" (or anywhere else you like)
    Repository URL: https://mpc-hc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mpc-hc/trunk
    The recommended SVN client is TortoiseSVN (grab it from http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads)
2. When using TortoiseSVN
    a) Create an empty directory where you want to store the source files. e.g: "C:\mpc-hc"
    b) Right-click on that directory and choose "SVN checkout".
    c) Put "https://mpc-hc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mpc-hc/trunk" in "URL of Repository" and press OK.
    d) Wait for the source tree to be downloaded.
3. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpc-hc.sln"
    Change the solution's configuration to "Release" (in the toolbar).
4. Right click the mpc-hc project, and open up its Properties.
   There, go to Configuration Properties->Linker->General. Add the following directories to the "Additional Library Directories":
    For Win32 platform      $(MPCHC_MINGW32)\lib\gcc\i686-pc-mingw32\4.7.0;$(MPCHC_MINGW32)\i686-pc-mingw32\lib\
    For x64 platform        $(MPCHC_MINGW64)\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\4.7.0;$(MPCHC_MINGW64)\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\

Note: If you update your GCC, make sure you change the version number in the above paths, e.g. 4.7.1
5. Press OK to save the changes and close the Properties window.

Another way to do the abpve step is by copying the needed libraries (libgcc.a and libmingwex.a)
into the "C:\mpc-hc\lib" and "C:\mpc-hc\lib64" folders either manually or by using the following batch snippet:

@ECHO OFF
REM Save this script to your mpc-hc source dir
IF EXIST "build.user.bat" (
  CALL "build.user.bat"
) ELSE (
  IF DEFINED MINGW32 (SET MPCHC_MINGW32=%MINGW32%)
  IF DEFINED MINGW64 (SET MPCHC_MINGW64=%MINGW64%)
  IF DEFINED MSYS    (SET MPCHC_MSYS=%MSYS%)
)

REM Set the GCC version
FOR /F "tokens=1,2 delims= " %%K IN ('gcc -dumpversion') DO (SET "gccver=%%K")

REM Copy the needed libraries
ECHO x86:
COPY /V /Y "%MPCHC_MINGW32%\lib\gcc\i686-pc-mingw32\%gccver%\libgcc.a"    "lib\"
COPY /V /Y "%MPCHC_MINGW32%\i686-pc-mingw32\lib\libmingwex.a"             "lib\"
ECHO x64:
rem See Part D for libmingwex.a x64
COPY /V /Y "%MPCHC_MINGW64%\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\%gccver%\libgcc.a" "lib64\"

PAUSE
EXIT /B

6. Press F7 to build the solution.
7. You now have "mpc-hc.exe" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86"
8. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpciconlib.sln"
9. Press F7 to build the solution.
10. You now have "mpciconlib.dll" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86"
11. Open the solution file "C:\mpc-hc\mpcresources.sln"
    In Visual Studio go to Build->Batch Build->Press Select All->Press Build
12. You now have "mpcresources.XX.dll" under "C:\mpc-hc\bin\mpc-hc_x86\Lang"

Alternatively, you can use "build.bat" which can build everything for you
(run: build.bat help for more info)


Part D: Building FFmpeg x64 (libavcodec) with GCC

When building FFmpeg (project libavcodec) GCC is used and according to the makefile that is automatically invoked from the project file. Doing so for 64 bit, requires some additional steps in order to successfully link the MinGW64 library:
 1. Run MSYS and cd to the trunk\src\filters\transform\MPCVideoDec\ffmpeg_x64 folder
Example: cd /c/mpc-hc/src/filters/transform/MPCVideoDec/ffmpeg_x64/
 2. checkout the MinGW64 files by running: buildmingwlibs.sh --update
 3. run the buildmingwlibs.sh script, only to compile:
      buildmingwlibs.sh --compile
    or
      buildmingwlibs.sh --update --compile

After the compilation is done, "libgcc.a" and "libmingwex.a" will be placed in "C:\mpc-hc\lib64"

Now libavcodec can be compiled from within the MPC-HC visual studio solution file, and everything will be linked correctly with the other components.


Part E: Building the installer

Download Inno Setup Unicode v5.4.3 or newer from: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
Install everything and then go to "C:\mpc-hc\distrib", open "mpc-hc_setup.iss" with Inno Setup, read the first comments in the script and compile it.
Notes:
* "build.bat" can build the installer by using the "packages" switch.
* Use Inno Setup's built-in IDE if you want to edit the iss file.
