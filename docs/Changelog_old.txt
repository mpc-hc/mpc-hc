1.7.0 - 29 September 2013

+ Replace the internal filters with LAV Filters.
  LAV Filters are modern open source DirectShow filters based on FFmpeg. They are known
  to be reliable and fast and overall should be more stable than the old filters.
  MPC-HC integrates LAV Filters directly and no extra installation steps are required.
  The embedded version of LAV Filters doesn't interfere at all with other installed
  DirectShow filters (including the standalone versions of LAV Filters).
  Note to XP users: hardware decoding is only supported on NVIDIA graphic adapters. If you
  really need a DXVA decoder, you can use a standalone version of MPC Video Decoder.
+ Support loading HTTP/RTSP/UDP/RTP streams using embedded source filters
+ D3DFullscreen can now switch to windowed mode (just like regular fullscreen mode)

  exhibited by the source filter and the external tracks

* When "Prefer external subtitles over embedded subtitles" is enabled, an external track is
  always selected by default even if an embedded track matches a preferred language
* The "Go To" menu entry has been moved to the "Navigate" menu
* D3DFullscreen changes:
  - toggle hotkey is now disabled by default
  - support for madVR has been removed (it already has exclusive mode)
  - 10-bit RBG output now falls back to 8-bit output if the display does not support it
