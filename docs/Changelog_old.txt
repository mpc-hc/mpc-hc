1.6.7 - 25 April 2013
=====================
+ DVB capture: Improve channel switching
+ Subtitle downloader improvements:
  - Ticket #2144, Sort by language and then by filename by default. Subtitles matching a language
    set as preferred in the options are now displayed first in the result list
  - Ticket #2926, Double-clicking or pressing the "Enter" key will download the selected subtitle(s)
+ Ticket #2837, New INI parser: the accesses are now cached for faster settings loading/saving.
  Using the INI file should now be as fast as using the registry

  cases "On top -> Default" will have the exact same behavior than "On top -> Never"
  but it won't try to override the "On top" flag if an external tool sets it
* Ticket #3049, Re-enable VSync by default for Windows XP users
! Fix a crash when VMR-7 (renderless) renderer failed to load

1.6.6 - 17 March 2013
=====================
+ Formats: The space key can now be used to enable/disable formats
+ Miscellaneous: Add button to export key bindings
+ Add the ability to choose the scale factor (relative to the screen size) for
  the auto-fit zoom
+ Internal Subtitles Renderer: Show all subtitles tracks in the Play -> Subtitles menu.
  That includes all the embedded tracks exhibited by the source filter and the external tracks.
+ Add a new shader that over brightens with gradient from the bottom to the top of the screen.
  It needs LCD monitors with low viewing angle (~170/160).
+ DVB: Remember audio and subtitle track selection.
+ Add an OSD reminder when Escape is pressed in D3D Fullscreen

    supported but MPL2 files that use MicroDVD tags for formatting are quite common.

  the location of the DVD/BD player (or folder) when this option is enabled.

* Disabled Frame Time Correction hotkey by default
* DVB: Some filters that are known to be incompatible with the BDA source filters are now blacklisted
* External filters: Use two separated lists for x86 and x64 since x86 filters only work with MPC-HC x86
  and vice versa
* Ticket #978, Apply the "Repeat" option after "Play next in the folder": the option will now take
  effect after the next file in the folder was played (similarly to what happens for playlist items)
* Ticket #1620, UI: Use the new styled radio bullet for menu's items
* Ticket #2878, Removed obsolete MSN Messenger support
* Ticket #2924, Use the current file directory as default folder for the "Load Subtitles" dialog
