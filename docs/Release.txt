Here is a quick how-to release a new stable build:

1) Make sure you have a clean source tree, no modified files included
2) Update the date in Changelog.txt
3) Create an svn tag for the new release
4) Compile MPC-HC and the standalone filters
5) Keep the PDB files of all the filters and MPC-HC builds
6) Upload the binary packages on SF following the directory and the packages names scheme
   (upload the PDB files too, use 7zip for creating the 7z packages)
7) Update the webpage with the new download links, history and version.txt with
   the new version number (in the SF FTP)


In the next commit, bump the version:

1) In "include/Version.h"
2) In "src/mpc-hc/res/mpc-hc.exe.manifest.conf" and
   "src/mpc-hc/res/mpc-hc.exe.manifest.template"
