Here is a quick how-to release a new stable build:

1) Make sure you have a clean source tree, no modified files included
2) Compile MPC-HC and the standalonee filters
3) Update the revision number and the date in the Changelog.txt
4) Crate a tag for the new release
5) Keep the PDB files of all the filters and MPC-HC builds
6) Upload the binary packages on SF following the directory and the packages names scheme
   (you can also upload the PDB files too, use 7zip for creating the 7z packages)
7) Update the webpage with the new download links and the history


After that bump the version:

1) In "include/Version.h"
2) In "src/mplayerc/res/mpc-hc.exe.manifest.conf" and
   "src/mplayerc/res/mpc-hc.exe.manifest.template"
