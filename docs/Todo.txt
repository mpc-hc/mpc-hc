Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code
2) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing, buffer overruns etc
3) Try to clean up the includes; there are a lot of unneeded includes, or includes which are
   inherited from files they shouldn't be and are not included directly in the files that need them
4) Try to speed up compilation by doing the above and also by optimizing the included headers
   in stdafx.h for mpc-hc.vcxproj.
5) Reorganize the player's Options
6) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
7) Update Bento4 library or see if we can use ffmpeg for this job
8) Use "new" instead of "DNew" and make sure the leak detection works properly
9) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one
10) Test MSVC 2012 more when it's released. With the RC we get random new errors when building Virtualdub/system.
    With the Beta we got hundreds of redefinitions for the DX headers which seems normal
    since DX is moved into the SDK but we have to use the DX SDK for d3dx9, linking fails if /SAFESEH:NO
    isn't specified (still happens with the RC for Win32) and the MFC bloat workaround does not work as it is
    and unfortunately it is still needed.
11) Switch to git; we need a proper script to get the revision number
12) Get rid of images/avi and stuff from the mpcresources;
    the gain will be ~1.5MB less from the installer/packages

MPCIconLib:
1) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

WebServer:
1) Enable caching
2) Fix the problems with unicode names
3) Update the images for player.html

FFmpeg:
1) Stop linking ffmpeg statically (still not sure about it yet)
2) Use ffmpeg for:
   * MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this would remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
   * FLAC decoding (this would remove the dependency on libflac)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and integrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mpc-hc/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from Version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Do we need the ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED define?
4) Fix the YUV2 bug causing subtitles not to show
5) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
