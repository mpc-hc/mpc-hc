Patches are always welcome. :)

MPC-HC:
1) Try to fix all /W3 warnings for Win32 in our code
2) Fix all coverity scan issues for our code
3) Run /analyze and fix some of the errors; memory leaks, NULL pointer dereferencing,
   buffer overruns etc
4) Remove support for unneeded/obsolete renderers
5) Update Bento4 library or see if we can use ffmpeg for this job
6) Replace the default old looking toolbar with a more modern one
7) Add FFmpeg as submodule

MPCIconLib:
1) Replace the file association icons with better looking ones

WebServer:
1) Update the images for player.html using a css sprite
2) Switch to html5

FFmpeg:
1) Use ffmpeg for MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 decoding (this will remove the dependency on libmpeg2)
Alternatively, drop all internal decoders and filters and integrate LAVFilters, but keep DXVA1.

FLACSource:
1) Use ffmpeg instead of libflac

Installer:
1) Add file association tasks, see https://trac.mpc-hc.org/ticket/2207

VSFilter:
1) Use the defines from version.h for MPC_COPYRIGHT_STR in VSFilter
2) Define VSFilter's version numbers in a place accessible by its installer and VSFilter itself
3) Do we need the ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED define?
4) Backport a few useful patches from those VSFilter forks;  we need individual patches for that
   and we have to make sure that everything works right for mpc-hc itself
