Zita-resampler is a C++ library for sample rate conversion of
audio signals. Full documentation is available in HTML format,
see the 'docs' directory.


Release 1.6.2  (25/08/2018)
---------------------------

* Maintenance release.


Release 1.6.0  (16/10/2016)
---------------------------

* Added VResampler::set_phase ().


Release 1.2.0  (25/09/2012)
---------------------------

* Added the zretune application and its manpage.


Release 1.1.0  (26/01/2012)
---------------------------

* VResampler class added - provides arbitrary and variable
  resampling ratio, see docs.

* This release is NOT binary compatible with previous ones
  (0.x.x) and requires recompilation of applications using it.

* This release is API compatible with the previous one. But if
  you are using the now deprecated filtlen() function please
  replace this by inpsize() which provides the same information. 

* The inpdist() function has been added, see docs.

* The ratio_a() and ratio_b() calls have been removed, if this
  is a problem (I'd be surprised) they can be added again.

* The include files are now in $PREFIX/include/zita-resampler/.
  Please DO remove any old ones manually after installing this
  version. Compiling using the old includes and linking with
  the new library will create havoc.

* #defines and static functions are added for compile time and
  run time version checking, see resampler-table.h.
